# üß¨üéµ Multi-Objective Optimization for Audio Compression
This project aims to optimize the compression of WAV audio files to MP3 using Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) and an Improved Metric of Informational Masking (IM), both audioperception metrics based on a human ear model. The primary goal is to minimize file size while retaining the highest possible perceptual quality.

This is achieved through an automated framework that employs an evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm intelligently explores various FFmpeg (specifically, LAME MP3) encoding settings to identify optimal trade-offs. The framework orchestrates the entire process: it handles audio compression, evaluates the resulting audio quality using the specified metrics, and then leverages genetic algorithms to converge on a set of Pareto-optimal compression configurations specifically tailored to the input audio content. This approach helps users achieve a balance between file efficiency and listening experience.

‚ùïBefore running this project, you'll first need to successfully install the GST Peaq plugin for the GStreamer framework. That's no easy task, so I prepared a step-by-step guide to help with that purpose.

## üì¶ Requirements

The requirements could be installed through either `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt`

For system-level tools, you'll need to use your operating system's package manager to install them. You should use `brew install` for macOS or `sudo apt install` for Linux. Installing these tools on Windows can be more complex.

## üìÇ Project Structure

* `evolution.py`: Implements the core multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II) using `DEAP`. It defines the genes (audio compression parameters) and orchestrates the evaluation of individuals.
* `orchestrator.py`: Acts as the central hub for the evaluation process. It calls `compressor.py` to compress audio and `peaq.py` to assess the quality of the compressed file. It also measures file size and total processing time.
* `compressor.py`: Handles the actual audio compression from WAV to MP3 using `ffmpeg-python`, applying the parameters specified by the evolutionary algorithm.
* `peaq.py`: Provides an interface to the external `peaq` command-line tool, used for objective perceptual audio quality measurements. It also manages environment variables for correct tool execution.
* `audiofile_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for quick analysis of audio file properties (e.g., sample rate, bitrate) using `pydub`.
* `./media/`: Directory intended for input WAV files and generated MP3 output files.
* `./logs/`: Contains log files (.log) detailing the execution flow, debugging information, and significant events of the evolutionary algorithm. Each run generates a timestamped log file.
* `./history/`: Stores CSV files (.csv) containing the full evolutionary history, including parameters, fitness values (file size, PEAQ score, distortion index), and processing time for each evaluated individual. Each run generates a timestamped CSV for distinct record-keeping.
* `./results/`: Holds processed output or final outcome files (e.g., CSVs of the best-performing individuals or specific analysis results) from the evolutionary runs (HOF).
